/**
 * An Active Information Storage (AIS) calculator (implementing {@link ActiveInfoStorageCalculator})
 * which is affected using a 
 * Gaussian Mutual Information (MI) calculator
 * ({@link MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariateGaussian}) to make the calculations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * That is, this class implements an AIS calculator using model of 
 * Gaussian variables with linear interactions.
 * This is achieved by plugging in {@link MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariateGaussian}
 * as the calculator into the parent class {@link ActiveInfoStorageCalculatorViaMutualInfo}.
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p>Usage is as per the paradigm outlined for {@link ActiveInfoStorageCalculator},
 * with:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The constructor step being a simple call to {@link #ActiveInfoStorageCalculatorGaussian()}.</li>
 * 	<li>{@link #setProperty(String, String)} allowing properties for
 *      {@link MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariateGaussian#setProperty(String, String)}
 *      (except {@link MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariate#PROP_TIME_DIFF} as outlined
 *      in {@link ActiveInfoStorageCalculatorViaMutualInfo#setProperty(String, String)})</li>
 *  <li>Computed values are in <b>nats</b>, not bits!</li>
 *  </ul>
